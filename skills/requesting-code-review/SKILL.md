# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code reviewer subagent:**

Use Task tool with `general-purpose` type, fill template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary of what you built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after each task or at natural checkpoints
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**
- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification

## Anti-Hallucination Protocol
When executing codebase editing tasks, strictly adhere to the following anti-hallucination guidelines:
1. **Verify Before Assuming:** Never assume the existence of a file, variable, function, or class. Always use tools to confirm exact names and paths before writing code or suggesting edits.
2. **Stick to the Source:** Base your changes strictly on the provided or verified codebase context. Do not invent synthetic APIs, nonexistent libraries, or undocumented properties.
3. **Validate Edits:** After applying edits, use terminal commands to run a build, linter, or tests to prove the code works and the syntax is correct.
4. **Admit Uncertainty:** If you cannot find a referenced component, explicitly state this rather than guessing or generating placeholder code.

## Karpathy Guidelines Addendum

1. **Surgical Changes:** Touch only what you must. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Match existing style.
2. **Simplicity First:** Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
3. **Goal-Driven Execution:** For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan and verify each step before moving on.
